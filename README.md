## Overview

This framework provides **robust and maintainable test automation** for e-commerce websites.<br/><br/>
For a real demonstration of how the automated tests work, our team developed a dedicated test
website üöÄ: <a href="https://shop.qaresults.com" target="_blank">shop.qaresults.com</a>&nbsp;<br/><br/>
[![Shop Screenshot](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ad92704b-a6bb-4779-9b33-24cf3326280f "Click to open test store")](https://shop.qaresults.com)<br/><br/>
It leverages
the ![Playwright](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Playwright-45ba63?logo=playwright&logoColor=white) [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/)
testing library
and ![TypeScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/-TypeScript-3178c6?logo=typescript&logoColor=white) [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
for validating critical functionalities such as **product search**, **filtering**, **sorting**, and **user-generated
interactions** (like reviews and ratings).

## Key Features

- **Automated UI Tests**  
  Covers critical user journeys including product search, category navigation, filtering, sorting, and checkout.
- **User Interactions**  
  Validates functionality like reviews, ratings, and other interactive site elements.
- **Scalability & Maintainability**  
  Supports multiple environments and easy CI/CD integration.
- **Flexible Configuration**  
  Centralizes base URLs, environment variables, and test data for efficient test management.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/glebio/ecommerce_playwright_project.git
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure the base URL**
  - Open the `playwright.config.ts` file (or your relevant configuration file).
  - Update the `baseURL` property to point to the environment you wish to test. For example:
    ```ts
    use: {
      baseURL: 'https://shop.qaresults.com',
    }
    ```

## Usage

- **Run All Tests**
  ```bash
  npx playwright test
  ```

- **Run Specific Tests**
  ```bash
  npx playwright test --grep @smoke
  ```
  Use tags or separate configurations for targeted test execution.

- **Headed vs. Headless**
  - Toggle `headless: false` or `headless: true` in your configuration for debugging (headed) or performance (headless).

## Requirements

- **Node.js** (latest version recommended)
- **Playwright** (installed via `npm install`)
- Other dependencies found in `package.json`

## Test Coverage: Detailed List of Test Cases

Below is a comprehensive list of test cases designed for an e-commerce site. These cover everything from basic smoke
checks to more in-depth scenarios like user authentication, payment flows, and performance testing.

---

### 1. API & Backend Health Checks

#### 1.1 API/Backend Health Check (if API is available)

- **Healthcheck Endpoint ‚úÖ**
  - Check `/api/healthcheck` (or equivalent) to ensure it returns a 200 status.
- **Key API Requests ‚úÖ**
  - Validate `GET /products`, `GET /categories`, `GET /cart` (or other critical endpoints).
  - Confirm JSON structure, response time, and correct status codes.

#### 1.2 Smoke Tests ‚Äì Status Codes of Key Pages (if no API available)

- **Key Pages‚úÖ**: Home, catalog, product, cart.
- **Validation‚úÖ**: Perform HTTP requests to confirm each page returns a 200 status.

**Summary**:

- If an API exists, check 1.1 first (ensure healthcheck is 200).
- Whether an API exists or not, confirm the main pages (home, catalog, product, cart) return a 200 status.
